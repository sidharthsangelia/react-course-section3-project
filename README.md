# React Basics Project

This project is a simple React application I built as part of my ReactJS course. It helped me get hands-on experience with core React concepts and build a solid foundation in front-end development using React.

## 🚀 What I Learned

Through this project, I explored and implemented several key concepts in React:

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**  
  Learned how to display dynamic values and content using JSX.

- **useState Hook**  
  Used the `useState` hook to manage and update component state.

- **Rendering Lists with `.map()`**  
  Practiced rendering lists dynamically using the `.map()` function.

- **Conditional Styling**  
  Applied styles conditionally based on state or props.
